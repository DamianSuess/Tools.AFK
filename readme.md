## Away From Keyboard Utility

This simple tool is an example of how to keep your screen saver from triggering.

Useful during presentations or conducting meetings where you're sharing your screen but not using something like PowerPoint which stops your screen saver from showing up.

## Methods Used
This app employs a couple of different methods

### Keyboard presses the F20 key
This key no longer exists on modern keyboards, however, it is still registered with OSs like Windows 10

### Mouse Movement
Uses a settle mouse movement. However, this doesn't always get picked up when moving only a couple of pixels and some admin policies protect against this method. This method can also become annoying when presenting and you need precision.
